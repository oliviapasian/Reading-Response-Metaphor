        <p id="section1">I think a website could be like a ball of yarn. It could unspool as you go along and you’d have to keep
            unspooling to reach the end.</p>
        <p id="section2">The website could curve in unpredictable ways or it could be pulled taut in a line. It could come apart quickly
            or slowly. </p>
        <p id="section3">It could be any colour you want and maybe the colours change part of the way through. Maybe you weave it into a
            pattern, like knitting a sweater or crocheting a scarf.</p>
        <p id="section4">You could even pull it apart again and start over. It’s anything you can shape out of a line.</p>
